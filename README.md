# Effects of Complex Sampling and correction methods in Machine Learning Applications
## Research Case Studies, Trier University, Winter semester 2021/2022

The goals of this research case study are to

1. Evaluate the impact of complex sampling methods on ML models in regression context
2. Apply sampling correction techniques to evaluate predictive quality of ML models
3. Compare predictive power of ML models using different smapling and correction techniques

All in all, the process model will look like this:

We will be using the AMELIA dataset and perform an income prediction with the goal of determining poverty rates. AMELIA is an open source data set provided by the University of Trier. To access the dataset visit http://amelia.uni-trier.de/?p=287.
